Loan default prediction

Problem Statement:

The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or
non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a
defaulter.
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the
applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

● If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to
the company

● If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan
may lead to a financial loss for the company.
Credit risk analysis will help the company to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s
profile. Which controls loss of business to the company and avoid financial loss for the company.
